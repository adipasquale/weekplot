# WeekPlot

## What is it ?

WeekPlot is a journaling app that aims to sketch out all your lifespan (past and upcoming) in a single page.
The lowest unit of time is the week, therefore it will take up 90 years times 52 weeks = 4680 little squares.
All inspiration and credits should righteously go to this [waitbutwhy.com blog post](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)

## Usage

A running and free version of this app will soon be available on [weekplot.com](http://www.weekplot.com), and you can also host it yourself if you wish.

## Security

WeekPlot is NOT secure (yet). please don't store anything too private on it.

## Tech
